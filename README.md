### Agentic Workflow- 
1.	Planner Agent â€“ Break down the user question into multiple chunks and suggest valid points on how to perform the operations, clauses, and add constraints
2.	Data Analyst Agent- Understand the intent of the user query thoroughly before framing the SQL query, ensuring it translates the query correctly with all necessary details.
3.	Critics Agent - Evaluate an SQL query generated based on a intent of the user question and has to provide a score either 0 or 1. If the SQL query execution results in an error, give a numeric score of 0 and provide a critic message

5.	Insight Generator Agent- Analyze the dataframe provided by SQL executor agent and provide textual insights and plots based on the user question.
